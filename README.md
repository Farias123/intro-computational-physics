# Computational Physics

This repository keeps exercises and projects from my computational physics and introduction to computational physics classes.

## Programs

The repository contains programs such as a solver for constant acceleration motion exercises, a lister of informations about an arbitrary x, a lister of all the prime numbers to 100, etc.

## made-in-class

In this folder I dump all the exercises and projects made in class.
